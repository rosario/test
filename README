1) A brief description of the functionality your solution provides to the users

Columns can be sorted. Search box provided.

2) How to open your solution in a browser and use it with a sample dataset

Open index.html in a browser

3) How to run any tests you have included

No tests

4) Reasons/justification for each library or framework you decide to use, if any

From the spec: "You may use any UI libraries and frameworks".

Jquery DataTable is a very popular solution to display/search on tabular data

5) Reasons for your choice of data format and protocol for the API. If you chose to use a simpler protocol
than you would in production, please also explain the protocol you would use for this problem in production

Since it's a test, there is no protocol defined. In production a REST server can provide data via JSON on http.
The same library can be used to query data via AJAX.

6) Assumptions you made, if any, due to unclear requirements

From the spec: "Please implement the solution as a web-based UI. You may use any UI libraries and frameworks"
Since it's quite broad I assumed I could use ANY library, hence choosing DataTable.
